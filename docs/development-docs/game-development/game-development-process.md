# Game Development Steps

Create your first level, then your final boss/win state and you have a complete game, 
after that you can iterate and add more content.

1. Design the idea, genre, 2d or 3d
2. Design Mechanics
3. Make a "Test Level"
4. Prototype mechanics inside the Test Level
5. Design the characters, types of enemy if the games has this kind of content
6. Make concept art of levels and characters
7. Slowly make the Test Level looks a finished level to test mechanics with interaction and animations
8. When the Test Level looks more like a finished game I design the UI/UX
9. Start designing levels and making its prototype
10. For specific level mechanics I design them on the Test Level and when it is finished I insert them on the actual level
11. Add the final art to the game
12. Polish everything
